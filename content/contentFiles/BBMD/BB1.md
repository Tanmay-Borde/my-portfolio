>When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the company was just 90 days away from bankruptcy. His first major move was to eliminate all general managers, unify the company's business units under a single Profit & Loss (P&L) structure, and consolidate all functional departments under one roof. This restructuring laid the groundwork for a culture that priorities functional expertise and product-driven innovation.

>## **Product-Driven Mindset and Management Style**
>At Apple, decisions are made by subject matter experts (SMEs) with deep knowledge and experience in their respective fields. This product-driven mindset ensures that those with the most relevant expertise lead the decision-making process, particularly in product development. Apple’s product decisions are largely insulated from financial pressures and short-term profit goals. Instead, the focus is on creating the best possible products, even if it means taking longer or spending more. This approach fosters a commitment to quality and innovation evident in Apple’s product launches and feature releases. Every product is viewed as part of a broader puzzle, with cross-functional teams working cohesively to ensure the entire product portfolio fits together seamlessly.

>## Expert team at the centre
>Having leaders who are experts in their fields allows Apple to dive deep into the details. These leaders push, probe, and identify crucial issues, ensuring every aspect of a product is meticulously crafted. Many at Apple find it liberating, even exhilarating, to work for such experts, who provide better guidance and mentoring than a general manager would. Apple’s organisational structure places these expert leaders at the centre, rather than dividing them into different divisions or business units.

>For example, if you look closely, the Squircle curve edges of the iPhone has exact same dimensions on the edges of iPad, MacBook, AirPods and even the software UI elements ensuring a consistent design language. The difference is subtle that demands precision, immersion in details and exceptional cross team collaboration that's ingrained in the top leadership itself and trickles down throughout the company. This is the level of control they have over the product development across the teams.

>## Collaborative Debate Approach
>Every team of specialists at Apple brings their unique expertise to the table, collaborating, debating, and pushing each other to create the best possible product. This collaborative approach immerses teams in details and shifts the focus from isolated development to cohesive teamwork. A prime example is the portrait photo feature with a blurred background on the iPhone. Initially, the camera team designed it so users could see the effect only after taking a photo. However, the Human Interface (HI) Design team argued for a live preview, enabling users to adjust settings before taking the shot. Despite initial doubts from the camera team about feasibility, they persisted, and after extensive engineering effort, the video engineering team found a solution. The result was Portrait mode, a standout feature in the iPhone 7 Plus that played a major role in its success and customer satisfaction. This half baked feature like many gimmicky features of competitor smartphone brands could have made to the production if it wasn’t for the Human Interface team at Apple to push back and reengineer for better UX.\
>At Apple, this process of collaborative debate involves people from various functions who challenge, promote, or reject ideas, building on one another’s concepts to create the best solutions. It’s known as “accountability without control”—you’re accountable for the project’s success, even though you don’t control all the teams. This messy yet productive process focuses on long-term goals over short-term interests. When teams prioritize their agendas over common goals, it’s called “bad mess,” and those associated with it are often removed from leadership positions or from Apple altogether.

>## Leaders Over General Managers
>Steve Jobs once said, **“Do you know who the best managers are? They are the great individual contributors who never, ever want to be a manager but decide they have to be because no one else is going to do as good a job.”** Apple isn’t a company where general managers oversee managers; it’s a company where experts lead experts. In this environment, specialists create a deep bench in their areas, learning from one another. For example, Apple’s more than 600 camera hardware technology experts work in a group led by Graham Townsend, a camera expert. If Apple were organised traditionally, these experts would be scattered across product lines, diluting their collective expertise. Instead, Apple keeps A-players at the top, who self-police to hire and retain only the best talent. This ensures that decisions are made by the people most qualified to make them.

>## First Principles and Foundational Thinking
>Steve Jobs often quoted computer scientist Alan Kay: **“People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.”** Apple has embraced this philosophy, achieving a level of hardware and software optimisation that remains unmatched by competitors. While companies like Google and Samsung rely on each other—Google for software, Samsung for hardware—Apple has been independently building its integrated ecosystem from day one. This unified approach allows Apple to make calculated bets on fundamental, emerging technologies, while quickly phasing out older products and innovations when necessary.

>A prime example is Apple’s early investment in ARM-powered processors. Initially powering devices like the iPod and iPhone, this strategic move laid the foundation for innovations across the entire product line, from AirPods to Vision Pro. It also enabled Apple to lead the industry in transitioning laptops from Intel’s x86 processors to ARM-based silicon, setting new benchmarks in performance and efficiency. Many competitors have since followed suit, taking cues from Apple’s pioneering efforts.

>## Building Something They Want for Themselves
>When asked why Apple doesn’t cater to the mass market, Steve Jobs boldly stated, **“Our goal is to make the best personal computer products in the world that we’re proud to sell and recommend to our family and friends. We just can’t ship junk, and we do not offer stripped-down, lousy products.”** This statement underscores Apple’s unwavering commitment to top-tier quality and a consistent user experience (UX) across all its products. Unlike competitors who prioritise market share and profits—often resulting in a wide disparity in quality within their product lines—Apple maintains a unified standard across its entire lineup. Whether it’s an iPhone, MacBook, or any other device, you can expect the same level of quality and a cohesive, seamless UX.

>## Meticulous Attention to Detail
>Apple’s commitment to excellence extends beyond just the functionality of its products. The company’s attention to even the smallest details is what sets it apart and creates an unparalleled user experience.
> - Apple Pencil Design: The weight distribution of the Apple Pencil is engineered so that the Apple logo always aligns at the top when rolled, reflecting Apple's dedication to intentional design.
> - Realistic Drawing Experience: The Apple Pencil is the first to replicate the tactile feel of a traditional pencil, capturing shadows, pressure sensitivity, and depth effects, making it a preferred tool for creative professionals.
> - Unboxing Experience: Apple product boxes are designed to open at a smooth, constant velocity, creating a refined and memorable unboxing experience.
> - Apple Watch Wallpapers: The animated flowering wallpapers on Apple Watch are real flowers, filmed for hundreds of hours as they bloomed, showcasing Apple's commitment to authenticity.

>There are numerous such examples and vast majority of people really don’t care about it, but here’s the quote from Steve Jobs’s lost interview that best illustrates the thoughtfulness: **"The way to ratchet up our species is to get better things to more people -products with spirit and creativity to understand the subtle aspects of it.”**

>## Making technology Humane
>Apple is usually late to the party when it comes to utility features, but here are some mainstream industry first features that are beyond just utility.
> - Personal Voice Feature: Designed for users at risk of losing their ability to speak, like ALS patients.
> - ECG and Fall Detection on Apple Watch: First ever smartwatch with Life-saving health features, with accident detection integrated.
> - Hearing Health in AirPods: Features to prevent hearing damage.
> - Screen Time Management: Helps users manage device and social media overuse.
> - Industry-Leading Privacy: On-device health and personal data storage for unmatched privacy and security.
> - Accessibility Features: Advanced tools for specially abled users.
> - Emergency SOS and Satellite Connectivity: Provides critical emergency services in remote areas.
> - Private Cloud Compute: Sets a new industry standard for privacy-focused cloud computing.

>The day when Apple starts making robot dogs or robot partners, I’ll be the first one to criticise. But so far, I believe Apple has retained the core values of **“Making Technology Humane”** with thoughtful design and engineering.

>## Conclusion
>Apple is not infallible; the company has made its fair share of mistakes, and the tech industry is one of the most fast-paced and volatile landscapes. In this consumer-facing sector, constant innovation is not just encouraged—it's necessary for survival. As companies grow larger, they often face complacency, with every decision becoming heavier due to internal resistance and organisational friction. Apple is no exception to these challenges. However, it appears that Apple has managed to maintain many of the core values instilled by Steve Jobs. I hope they continue to do so, as I personally want to see a company like Apple lead by setting the right ideals for the industry to follow.\
>Certainly, Apple’s vast resources, coupled with the top-tier talent it attracts, create a Goldilocks zone that enables it to innovate and secure victories with significant advantages. Yet, there’s something more—a certain magic that Apple seems to pull off repeatedly. This magic can only be attributed to a consciously institutionalised DNA of innovation and a strong focus on a larger vision that overshadows any obstacles in the way of building the best products in the world.
