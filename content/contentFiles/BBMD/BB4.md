Microsoft, in an event on May 20, is likely to announce its first set of Surface laptops, featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip. This will mark a significant shift from x86-based PCs to Advanced RISC Machine (ARM)-based personal computing devices. It’s not just Microsoft, several other original equipment manufacturers (OEM) such as Dell, Samsung, and more are likely to join this party by introducing their own ARM-based PCs.

At the event, Microsoft is also speculated to introduce new Windows 11 features and highlight how the OS has been optimised to run on the ARM platform. This may include new on-device generative AI features among others.

PCs, for a really long time, have been based on x86 architecture and are mostly powered by either an Intel or AMD CPU. While there have been a couple of ARM-based Windows laptops in the past, they haven’t been successful enough.

However, when Apple ditched Intel in favour of an in-house Apple Silicon for Macs, everything started to look different. An Apple-Silicon-based Mac was not just more powerful, but also more power efficient.
