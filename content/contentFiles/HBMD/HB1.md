>We’ve placed the story of humanity on a golden record, sent it into space aboard Voyager-1—a tiny bottle in the vast ocean of the cosmos—hoping that one day, someone or something will discover the dramatic saga of the human race. While the possibility of extraterrestrial discovery is uncertain, one thing is clear: humanity is here to witness, serve, and pass on its story to future generations.\
For those unfamiliar, Voyager-1 is the farthest human-made object from Earth, over 24.5 billion kilometres away as of 2024. The cover image, famously known as 'The Pale Blue Dot,' is the world’s first cosmic selfie—our tiny home captured from a distance of billions of kilometres.

There are two perspectives to look at the pale blue dot:
- The cosmic perspective makes us feel insignificant in the vast cosmos, where only we exist, and nobody can save us from ourselves. It humbles us, igniting a shift in perspective that dismantles the ego of a human-centric mindset, bringing us face-to-face with the uncertainties of existence. Edgar Mitchell, the sixth person to walk on the moon, perfectly illustrates this with his quote:
***'You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, "Look at that, you son of a bitch."'***\
This profound, implicit realisation is crucial in reminding us of the fragility of human life and our planet, the significance of coexistence, and the importance of being humane in caring more about the larger picture. This perspective makes us intricately curious, visionary, and mindful, encouraging us to value the objective and subtle experience of life over the subjective and narrow scope. It addresses and accepts the uncertainties of existence, helping us to become more conscious as a species. Ultimately, this perspective sheds light on the profound truths of our existence, helping us to appreciate life in a more meaningful and interconnected way.
- The micro perspective makes us feel far more significant in the vast cosmos, where we alone possess the surreal privilege of individual experience. It reminds us that we have just one life to live, making it comforting but also narrow and busy. We often forget that we’re living on a rock suspended in a cosmic void, yet this rock allows us to experience life in all its glory and drama. As Neil deGrasse Tyson aptly puts it, ***"The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.”*** This perspective, while offering some hope and structure, tends to overlook the fragility, uncertainties and randomness of existence, focusing instead on the limited scope of life. It helps us avoid overthinking and keeps us grounded in the act of living. However, this same perspective can also lead to mediocrity, as it emphasises the subjective experience of life over the objective. We become so deeply involved and invested in our own identities that we may lose sight of the broader existence beyond our immediate surroundings.\
To sum up: The macro perspective makes us feel insignificant and alone in the vastness of existence, where the entire world is ours to explore, and we live at the mercy of our own actions. In contrast, the micro perspective makes us feel incredibly special, as though the world revolves around us, with our lives seemingly guided or protected by some greater entity. Both views—**"The world and our lives are left to us"** and **"The world and our lives are not left to us"**—are equally daunting and important. On the spectrum of these two perspectives, an extreme macro view might drive us to abandon Earth in search of a new home, while an extreme micro view could lead us to hatred or violence, even in the name of religion.\
I believe life itself has no inherent purpose other than to be lived. Stop breathing for just two minutes, or ask your parents why you were born, and the purposelessness of life becomes clear. Yet, despite this, we exist—after trillions of permutations and combinations—on the only known planet in the universe that formed perfectly in the Goldilocks zone of the sun, with just the right circular orbit, and the exact atmospheric composition to sustain life. Add to this the timely asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs, denying them the chance to tell their own story. Given these miraculous circumstances, we should live with the purpose of serving one another and continuing to contribute to the story of humanity.\
To conclude, I’m reminded of Horace Mann's profound words: ***“Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.”*** This isn't about discontent; it's about finding contentment in discontent. In other words, it’s about being happy with what you have but never fully satisfied. As human beings, we should view the pale blue dot with both dissonance and solace—dissonance for not yet achieving a victory for humanity, and solace for having another beautiful day to pursue it. In the end, it’s people serving people, and humanity bearing witness to its own story.\
At the end, I want to leave you with this:

>*"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.*

>*The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.*

>*Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.*

>*The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.*

>*It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."*

>— Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994
