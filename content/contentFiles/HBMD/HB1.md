>This is the Golden Record—a testament to human existence etched on a golden disc and sent into space aboard Voyager-1. It's a tiny message in a vast, ever-expanding cosmic ocean, hoping that someday, someone—or something—will discover the dramatic saga of the human race. While the chances of extraterrestrial discovery remain uncertain, one thing is clear: humanity exists to witness, serve, and pass on its story to future generations.

>For those unfamiliar, Voyager-1 is the farthest human-made object from Earth, over 24.5 billion kilometers away as of 2024. Its famous image, ‘The Pale Blue Dot,’ is humanity’s first iconic cosmic selfie—our tiny home captured from billions of kilometers away. There are two perspectives to look at the pale blue dot:

>## The Cosmic Perspective

>The Cosmic Perspective shifts our mindset from a human-centric view to a cosmic-centric one. It humbles us, dismantling the illusion of human significance in the vastness of the universe, forcing us to confront the objective reality of our existence. The world and lifestyle we’ve constructed make it easy to forget—or worse, never realize—that we are simply another species of animals. The only significant difference between us and other creatures is our evolved brains; they don’t wear clothes or build cities.

>We've come a long way since the Earth was just oceans, land, and biodiversity. Everything we see, hear, live for, and die for today has been created by us and holds little relevance in the grand scheme of the cosmos. This fragile planet, our entire world, is a mere rock suspended in a void. It grants us the privilege to experience life in all its drama and glory, even though it may be cosmically insignificant. It’s a hard reality to comprehend from our limited vantage point, but it is akin to the depersonalization or the "Overview Effect" one might experience during a near-death event—seeing yourself from the outside for the first time.

>Edgar Mitchell, the sixth person to walk on the moon, perfectly captures this realization when he saw Earth from space: ”You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, ‘Look at that, you son of a bitch.’"

>This profound state of awe and self-transcendence is vital for every individual. It reminds us of the fragility of life on Earth and the urgent need for coexistence and well-being here and now—not in some imagined afterlife. For a brief moment, our identities—nationality, caste, creed, race, religion, ideologies—fade, leaving only our shared humanity. This perspective ignites curiosity, deepens our consciousness, and promotes mindfulness, compelling us to appreciate the objective reality beyond our limited, subjective lens. It encourages us to consider the grander scale of existence, not just through the narrow lens of personal survival, but as a unified species with shared responsibility.

>The Cosmic Perspective represents a fourth-dimensional evolution of the mind, moving from primal instincts to conscious awareness. It encourages us to carefully and practically perceive and deconstruct the world around us, transcending the limitations imposed by our upbringing, beliefs, and social conditioning. Ultimately, it reveals an often-overlooked truth: there’s far more happening in the universe than we can comprehend, and much of it matters more than the small cocoon we’re trapped in. It reminds us that Earth is our only home—no external help is coming, and no one can save us from ourselves but us.

>## The Micro Perspective

>The Micro Perspective is human-centric. It inflates our sense of significance in the cosmos, making us feel privileged, even entitled, as rulers of the Earth. We no longer view ourselves as animals but as special creatures, or perhaps the chosen ones, destined to walk this planet. This mindset drives conquerors, destroyers, and religious fundamentalists to kill millions over a fraction of land that is insignificant in the grand scale of the cosmos. It allows us to exploit nature, kill thousands of whales for oil to lubricate our machines, or flaunt ivory pianos as symbols of status. These actions reflect a micro perspective that is ignorant of the objective truth, trapped within a constrained outlook on the world.

>Like other animals, we too are emotional and social creatures, controlled by a part of our brain, the amygdala, which is responsible for our fight-or-flight responses and tribal instincts. Pair this with the complex human tendency to absorb layers of identities—nationality, religion, ideology—and we create beings willing to kill or die for beliefs.

>As Neil deGrasse Tyson aptly said, ***"The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you."*** Humans are designed to wonder, comprehend, find patterns and try to figure out the world to make sense out it and adopt to survive. However, we often become so entrenched in our perceptions that we blur the line between self-constructed and observable realities. The brain, lacks an innate "correction agent" to differentiate between subjective and objective truths. This is the reason we still have some people who are so deeply rooted into the belief of Earth being flat. An outsider might see it as absurd, but their neural pathways have been fired and wired to believe in this flat reality.

>We become so deeply involved and invested in our own identities that we may lose sight of the broader existence beyond our meager surroundings. While the micro perspective can provide comfort and meaning in a structured world, it falls short when it comes to handling uncertainties or profound questions of life.

>## Conclusion
>**“The world is left to us with free will”** and **“The world is not left to us with free will”** are equally daunting perspectives. We are shaped by our environments, and until individuals break free from the constraints of narrow worldviews, the notion of “Humanity First” will never be fully realized. Until we stop producing replicas of ourselves, a life of inclusiveness will not flourish.

>We live in a complex world where humans are first identified by their community, nationality, or ideology, and only last as human beings. So, we shouldn’t be surprised when humanity fails to shine through in communal hate and division. If we stop embedding people with endless identities, humanity will naturally surface. Let today's questions be answered by objective truths, and let us be humble enough to explore the unknown, gaining a better understanding of the world every day.

>Humanity has the unique ability to both zoom in and zoom out our perspectives, to live with more clarity and purpose. After all, life itself has no inherent purpose other than to be lived. Stop breathing for just two minutes, or ask your parents why you were born, and the purposelessness of life becomes clear. Yet, we exist-after trillions of permutations and combinations, on the only known planet in the universe that formed perfectly in the Goldilocks zone of the sun, with just the right circular orbit, and the exact atmospheric composition to sustain life. Add to this the timely asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs, denying them the chance to tell their own story.

>Given these miraculous circumstances, we should live with the purpose to serve one another and contribute to the collective human story. Without a cosmic perspective, there would be no Voyager-1, no Pale Blue Dot image, and no profound realization of our place in the universe. A mediocre life lived only with a micro perspective is like rolling back our evolution to waste a precious life with no contribution to the grand story of evolved human beings, because at the end of the day, it’s humanity serving and witnessing humanity!

>Finally, let me leave you with this excerpt:

>*"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.*

>*The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.*

>*Our posturing, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.*

>*It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."*
