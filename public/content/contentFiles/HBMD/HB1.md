We’ve placed the story of humanity on a golden record, sent it into space aboard Voyager-1—a tiny bottle in the vast ocean of the cosmos—hoping that one day, someone or something will discover the dramatic saga of the human race. While the possibility of extraterrestrial discovery is uncertain, one thing is clear: humanity is here to witness, serve, and pass on its story to future generations.\
For those unfamiliar, Voyager-1 is the farthest human-made object from Earth, over 24.5 billion kilometres away as of 2024. The image above, famously known as 'The Pale Blue Dot,' is the world’s first cosmic selfie—our tiny home captured from a distance of billions of kilometres.\
There are two perspectives to look at the pale blue dot:
- The cosmic perspective makes us feel insignificant in the vast cosmos, where only we exist, and nobody can save us from ourselves. It humbles us, igniting a shift in perspective that dismantles the ego of a human-centric mindset, bringing us face-to-face with the uncertainties of existence. Edgar Mitchell, the sixth person to walk on the moon, perfectly illustrates this with his quote: *'You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, "Look at that, you son of a bitch."'*\
This profound, implicit realisation is crucial in reminding us of the fragility of human life and our planet, the significance of coexistence, and the importance of being humane in caring more about the larger picture. This perspective makes us intricately curious, visionary, and mindful, encouraging us to value the objective and subtle experience of life over the subjective and narrow scope. It addresses and accepts the uncertainties of existence, helping us to become more conscious as a species. Ultimately, this perspective sheds light on the profound truths of our existence, helping us to appreciate life in a more meaningful and interconnected way.
- The micro perspective makes us feel far more significant in the vast cosmos, where we alone possess the surreal privilege of individual experience. It reminds us that we have just one life to live, making it comforting but also narrow and busy. We often forget that we’re living on a rock suspended in a cosmic void, yet this rock allows us to experience life in all its glory and drama. As Neil deGrasse Tyson aptly puts it, *"The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.”* This perspective, while offering some hope and structure, tends to overlook the fragility, uncertainties and randomness of existence, focusing instead on the limited scope of life. It helps us avoid overthinking and keeps us grounded in the act of living. However, this same perspective can also lead to mediocrity, as it emphasises the subjective experience of life over the objective. We become so deeply involved and invested in our own identities that we may lose sight of the broader existence beyond our immediate surroundings.\
To sum up: The macro perspective makes us feel insignificant and alone in the vastness of existence, where the entire world is ours to explore, and we live at the mercy of our own actions. In contrast, the micro perspective makes us feel incredibly special, as though the world revolves around us, with our lives seemingly guided or protected by some greater entity. Both views—"The world and our lives are left to us" and "The world and our lives are not left to us"—are equally daunting and important. On the spectrum of these two perspectives, an extreme macro view might drive us to abandon Earth in search of a new home, while an extreme micro view could lead us to hatred or violence, even in the name of religion.\
I believe life itself has no inherent purpose other than to be lived. Stop breathing for just two minutes, or ask your parents why you were born, and the purposelessness of life becomes clear. Yet, despite this, we exist—after trillions of permutations and combinations—on the only known planet in the universe that formed perfectly in the Goldilocks zone of the sun, with just the right circular orbit, and the exact atmospheric composition to sustain life. Add to this the timely asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs, denying them the chance to tell their own story. Given these miraculous circumstances, we should live with the purpose of serving one another and continuing to contribute to the story of humanity.\
To conclude, I’m reminded of Horace Mann's profound words: *“Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.”* This isn't about discontent; it's about finding contentment in discontent. In other words, it’s about being happy with what you have but never fully satisfied. As human beings, we should view the pale blue dot with both dissonance and solace—dissonance for not yet achieving a victory for humanity, and solace for having another beautiful day to pursue it. In the end, it’s people serving people, and humanity bearing witness to its own story.
